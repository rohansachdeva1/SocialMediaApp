## Project Goal
The purpose of this project is to create an interactive social media program, connecting users. The program will maintain user profiles (non-graphic is fine), storing information about their names, locations, interests and a list of their friends, as well as a user name and password for each member. Members should be able to log in to their profiles, add new friends, search for friends, and also get friend recommendations from the program. 

## Menu Requirements
After logging in, the program should display the user profile and also present a menu of options to the user.

Your project must offer the following options to the user:
- Login or Create a New Account
- View My Friends (has sub-menu)
    +View Friends Sorted by Name 
    +Search by Friend Name 
 - View this Friend's Full Profile 
     - Remove this Friend
- Make New Friends (has sub-menu)
    + Search by Name (user types a String name)
 - Add Friend
    + Search by Interest (user types a String interest)
         - Add Friend
    + Get Friend Recommendations
        - Add Friend
- Quit and Write Records to a File
 
At the end of the program, when the user selects the Quit option, the data should all be written to a file to allow for modifications to the data to be read in the next time the program is executed.
